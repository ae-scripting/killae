killae.sh  
======

This is a tiny shell script for killing ae on mac  
It is the result of a sunday morning mini idea after seeing [this quicktip](http://ae.tutsplus.com/tutorials/workflow/quick-tip-after-effects-force-quit-and-save/) by [Joe Lilli](http://ae.tutsplus.com/author/joe-lilli/)  

##Usage:  
    # kill AE CS 6 just type 
    killae.sh 6  
    # kill AE CS 5.5 just type 
    killae.sh 5.5  
    # kill AE CS 5 just type 
    killae.sh 5  

##Installation:  

open terminal and type:  
    
    cd /usr/local/bin

than  

    vi killae.sh  

you are in the vi editor  
- now hit __"i"__ once for the insert mode  
- and copy paste the script into it.  
- Than hit "ESC"  
- followed by holding "SHIFT" and hitting "z" two time.  

(Yes this is a wired editor. but useful).  

Now type in the terminal again  

    chmod +x killae.sh  

now your shell scipt is executable.  
Make sure the path `/usr/local/bin` is in your $PATH variable in your .bash_profile. If you don't have a .bash_profile or don't know what it is don't worry. Type in your terminal.  

    vi ~/.bash_profile  

- now hit __"i"__ once for the insert mode  
- and copy paste the 3 lines below into it.  
- Than hit __"ESC"__  
- followed by holding __"SHIFT"__ and hitting __"z"__ two time.  

btw if you dont go into insert mode you can hit __":q"__ and __"enter"__ to leave vi.
